python temporal expression library

This repo provides source code for building temporal expressions and date ranges in python.
Temporal Expressions as conceived in this library are inspired by Martin Fowler's PLOP presentation [here](http://martinfowler.com/apsupp/recurring.pdf).

The expression language Martin describes is fully implemented here, along with a few additions to make it possible to generate ranges of date/time and sequences of datetime objects.

Check out the tests folder for usage examples and you can get reasonable documentation using pydocs.

Enjoy!
